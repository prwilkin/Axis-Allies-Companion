This project was only achievable because of Matt Clemens (mclemens68 @ board game geek). His creation of the Excel 
Spreadsheet "AAG40-2nd-Edition-IPC-tracker-template_v1.0" complied so much data together into one place. Without this 
the project would have never moved forward as far to much information would not have been readily accesible. [Board Game
